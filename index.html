	<section> The history behind my pet turtles
		<p>I've had these turtles for about 3 years. I found them on a street abandoned and each one of them looked like they had injures on their little legs and head. I picked them off carefully because I didn't know if they had salmonela on its shells. I took them to a veterinarian to make sure they were going to be ok and do they need shots or anything else in my power. I still sometimes lose my turtles around the house panicking that they've died or something but later find out that one is in the bathtube, another one is under my bed, and the other two are in the kitchen looking for food. </p>

	<section> Each turtle and their names
		<p>The first turtle name is peque≈Ño (which means small in spanish) he is a shy little turtle and the hardest one to find out of the four. The second turtle name is the bull because he looks mean all the time and loves to eat. The third turtle name is spot because of the pop that ripples throughout his shell. The last one is named Terrance because he's a biggest one out of the four (also it's a character from angry birds). </p>

	<section> The struggle with having four turtles 
		<p>I have to make sure all four of my turtles have eaten a good throughout the day unless they start eating on other things that are not safe for their little bodies. You don't have to take them to a veterinarian but sometimes turtles can be bone diseases or other type of harm to their bodies. They are also sneaky little animals, once you take your eyes off of one of them the other one is under the couch, or in the bathroom. </p>
